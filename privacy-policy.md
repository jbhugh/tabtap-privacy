# TabTap Premium Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: March 26, 2025**

Thank you for using TabTap Premium! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your data when you use our app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency.

## 1. Data We Collect

TabTap Premium collects the following data to provide its features and improve user experience:

- **Audio Snippets for Song Recognition**:
  - When you use the song recognition feature, a short audio snippet is recorded and sent to a third-party song recognition API (e.g., ACRCloud) to identify the song.
  - We do not store these audio snippets ourselves. However, the third-party API provider may log metadata (e.g., the identified song, timestamp, or device information) for analytics or service improvement purposes. Please refer to the API provider’s privacy policy for details (e.g., [ACRCloud Privacy Policy](https://www.acrcloud.com/privacy-policy/)).

- **Song History**:
  - The app saves a history of identified songs locally on your device to persist across app launches. This data is not transmitted off your device or shared with us or any third parties.

- **Usage Data (Optional)**:
  - We may collect anonymized usage data, such as app interactions, crash reports, or performance metrics, to improve the app. This data is collected only if you enable analytics or crash reporting features (e.g., via Firebase Analytics or Crashlytics). You can opt out of analytics in the app settings (if applicable).

- **Links to Third-Party Services**:
  - When you tap links to Songsterr or Ultimate Guitar, these services may collect data (e.g., your IP address, device info, or tab access history) as per their own privacy policies. We do not share any additional user data with these services beyond what is necessary to open the link.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

We use the data we collect for the following purposes:
- To provide the song recognition feature by sending audio snippets to a third-party API.
- To improve the app’s performance and user experience through anonymized analytics (if enabled).
- To ensure the app functions as intended (e.g., saving song history locally for your convenience).

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with third parties except as necessary to provide the app’s features:
- **Song Recognition API**: Audio snippets are sent to a third-party API (e.g., ACRCloud) for song identification. We do not control how the API provider handles this data. Please review their privacy policy for more information.
- **Analytics Providers (Optional)**: If analytics are enabled, anonymized usage data may be shared with providers like Firebase Analytics to help us improve the app.

We do not sell your data to third parties.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: Song history is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
- **Third-Party Storage**: Audio snippets and metadata sent to the song recognition API are handled according to the API provider’s policies. We do not store this data ourselves.
- We take reasonable measures to protect your data, but no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 5. Your Choices

- **Analytics**: If the app includes analytics, you can opt out of data collection in the app settings (if applicable).
- **Song History**: You can clear your song history at any time within the app.
