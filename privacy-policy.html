Last Updated: March 16, 2025

TabTap ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application TabTap ("the App").

1. Information We Collect
- Audio Recordings: The App uses your device’s microphone to record short audio clips for song identification. These clips are processed locally and sent to ACRCloud for identification. We do not store audio recordings on our servers after processing.
- Usage Data: We may collect anonymized data about how you use the App (e.g., feature usage) to improve performance.
- Song History: Identified songs are saved locally on your device in the App’s history feature.

2. How We Use Your Information
- To identify songs and provide tablature links via Songsterr and Ultimate Guitar.
- To maintain your song history within the App (stored locally, not shared).
- No personal data is collected beyond what’s needed for these features.

3. Data Sharing
- We share audio clips with ACRCloud (third-party service) for song identification. See their privacy policy: https://www.acrcloud.com/privacy-policy/.
- We do not sell, trade, or share your data with others except as described.

4. Storage and Security
- Audio clips are deleted after identification.
- Song history is stored locally on your device and persists until you clear it.
- We use reasonable measures to protect data during transmission to ACRCloud.

5. Your Rights
- You can clear your song history anytime via the App’s “Clear” feature.
- No account is required, so no personal profiles are managed.

6. Children’s Privacy
- The App is not intended for users under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
